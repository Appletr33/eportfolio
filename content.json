My main hobby is programming which I learned by myself and practice every day. I find it extremely fun to create projects, particularly in computer graphics. I also have interests in biology, health and food, voxels, hiking, mountain biking, white water kayaking, finance, beekeeping, and landrace/natural farming."

During my childhood I was allergic to dogs and cats, so I never got the chance to take care of one, that was until last year, when the CDS (Cat Distribution System) changed that for me. Although the little rascal, Finn, requires a lot of attention, it's been an eye opening experience to be responsible for something living, and totally given me new perspective."
