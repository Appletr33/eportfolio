        "I'm a born-and-raised Oregonian that has a passion for creating and understanding things. I graduated from SEHS in 2023 and currently attend college at LCC. My main hobby is programming which I learnt by myself and practice every day. I find it extremely fun to create projects, particularly in computer graphics. I also have interests in biology, health and food, voxels, hiking, mountain biking, white water kayaking, finance, beekeeping, and landrace/natural farming. "
